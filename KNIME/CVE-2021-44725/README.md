## Description
The Profiles section of the KNIME server web application up to version 4.13.3 is vulnerable to Directory Path Traversal attacks.<br />By manipulating variables that reference files by prepending "dot- dot- slash (../)" sequences and their variations or by using absolute file paths, it is possible to access arbitrary files and directories stored on the file system including application source code, configuration, and database.

Due to the file-based architecture of the KNIME server application, this vulnerability allows stealing users' data such as password hashes, workflows, licenses, jobs, and so on.

No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.
