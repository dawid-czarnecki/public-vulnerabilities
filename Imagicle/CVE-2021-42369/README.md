## Description
Imagicle Application Suite for Cisco UC from version 2014.Winter.1 is vulnerable to SQL injection. A malicious low-privileged authenticated user could inject an SQL statement to the database through the "Export to CSV" of the Contact Manager web GUI. This could lead to disclosure of local administrator's password, which subsequently could be used to modify the application or make it nonfunctional.
